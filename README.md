## <a name='overview'>Overview</a>

The first project at General Assembly's (GA) Software Engineering Immersive (SEI-Flex) bootcamp was to build a game playable in a web browser using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I have decided to create a custom game, rather than recreating the most commonly selected projects - Battleships, Frogger, Pac-Man, Snake, Space-Invaders or Tetris.

The game was developed during the height of the Omicron wave and if hearing about covid all day was not enough - I have chosen it as a subject of the first project.

The aim of the game is to protect as much population from COVID by navigating the NHS bar with `left` and `right` arrows.

Just as in real life - you cannot protect everyone within the population from getting infected - hence you need to pick your battles. At the beginning of the game - that means picking virus hotspots, later in the game - it is trying to protect the population from the most recent virus strains - they will be harder to spot, harder to catch, but will reward with much more points!

Find the game too easy or too hard? Check out the Cheat Codes!
* `ienjoycheating` - Expands the NHS bar to the maximum width.
* `fairplayforall` - Brings back the NHS bar to original size.
* `iwantmyfreedom` - Removes all powerups from the game and allows the virus to spread uncontrollably.
* `doitfortheteam` - Brings back the powerups.
* `iwantitovernow` - Grants you maximum points to end the game. All you had to do is ask!
